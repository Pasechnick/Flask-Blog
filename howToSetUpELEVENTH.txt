we need to move out app to the blueprint so we can split it up to be more modular 

WE will restructure our app in different functions so we can create different instances 

Application factory

to create a blueprint we need to create a package in our app, that is named after its functionality

so in order to tell python that a particular directory is a package we need to create "__init__.py" file inside this directory and it does not need to contain anything 
 now within users, posts and main directories we have this 
 we also need to create routes files that only has routes that "work with it's functionality"

 same thing with forms...

 we also need to take some functions from right now app and relocate them in this packages according to it's functionality

 then we move routes from routes.py accordingly to packages...

 then we can update some configuration of our app so we can create many other instances of our app to make some tests it different inputs and outputs


 we move our configuration into a separate configuration file

 we also need to make a creation file to be able to make different instances of the app with different configurations
